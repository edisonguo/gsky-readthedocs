GSKY interacts with ArcGIS suite
===============================================================

This tutorial demonstrate how ArcGIS pro, ArcGIS Earth and ArcMap interact with GSKY Web Mapping Services (WMS). In this tutorial, you will learn to add the layer by calling GSKY WMS server. 



Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ArcGIS 

https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/
 
In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate 

* Create a map showing evacuation routes in Houston
* Use smart mapping and pop-ups to determine areas with low vehicle ownership.
* Configure a web app to share your findings with others.

0. Prerequisite 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lesson, you'll create a map that shows hurricane evacuation routes in Houston, Texas. First, you'll create a new map and locate Houston, Texas. Then, you'll add a map layer that shows evacuation routes. Lastly, you'll change the way your map and layers look to better display the data.

If you don't have an ArcGIS account, you can sign up for a free `public account`_ or an `ArcGIS free trial`_.

2. Choose a Basemap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click "Map" on the top bar. You will see a map with the dafault location. 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb4.png

Choose "Terrain with Labels" as the Basemap from the list. 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb5.png

Type the location in the search window on the right-top corner and click enter. Dismiss the "Search result" box. 
We will just use the default view or search "Australia" if the default view is not Australia.

3. Load GSKY layer onto a map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Click "Add | Add Layer from Web".

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb7.png

You will see a list of options from the drop down box below. Choose "A WMS OGC Web Service". 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb8.png

Type is "https://gsky.nci.org.au/ows/geoglam" in the URL box. Then click "ADD LAYER". You can tick the box beneath of URL box "Use as Basemap" if you like. 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb9.png

All data layers published through GSKY production server should be now available for you to choose. Click the grey arrow to expend the dataset list. Note if you untick the top layer "GSKY Web Map Service", all the GSKY layers will be invisible. 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb10.png

You can tick/untick the layer as you like. 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb11.png

You can change the layer's appearance for each layer. Put mouse on top of the "..." under each layer, a list of options will pop up as below. For example, you can increase the Transparency by moving the percentage bar. You can use this layer as the Basemap by clicking "Move to Basemap". You can also remove the layer by choosing "Remove" option.

4. Add Oil and Gas pipeline data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click "Add | Browse Living Atlas Layers".

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb13.png

Search "Australia" to see what database is available in this Living Atlas. Two layers are found: Oil and Gas Infrastrcutre and DEM SREM 1 Second Hydro Enforced. 

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb14.png

Choose "Oil_Gas_Infrastructure" and click "Add layer".

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb15.png

Close the layer information (step 1 in red circle) and go back to the map view (step 2 in red circle)

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb16.png

Two layers are shown on the map.

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb17.png

Drag and move to re-arrange the order of different layers.

.. image:: ../_static/images/GSKY_ArcGISweb18.png

Click "Details | Contents | Layer name | Transparency" to see through this layer.
